# NCAA_Wrestling_WebScraping
Webscraping the career stats of NCAA wrestlers found on WrestleStat.com

Using BeautifulSoup to scrape data for any particular wrestler, in order to put it in a dataframe for analyization. Also implementing python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for easier visualization of trends. Currently working on applying a KNN machine algorithim to predict outcome of future matchups.
